## Language as a priority

My projects are structured around multi-lingualism. As a linguist, it is a high priority that my work is in available in as many languages as possible. Currently, some projects support up to 109 languages per file, but this was impossible to maintain, and has been temporarily suspended. Almost all projects contain folders with subfolders and files for different languages and locales, such as the most common `EN-USA` (English (USA)) with more to be added in the future as translation becomes more automated. 

Some people claim that this is why all of my projects are "poorly structured" it is a common confusion. These serve a common purpose. Since old versions of files are archived outside of direct Git file history, these folders are most commonly present in `/OldVersions/` `/!OldVersions/` or `/.!OldVersions/` sub-directories (also the archaic `/OLD/` and `/!OLD/`) they seem excessive now, but in the future, they should be well populated.

## Esotoric languages

I have noted that it is hard to internationalize and localize esotoric languages, especially Whitespace.
